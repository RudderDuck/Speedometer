# Speedometer

A simple speedometer app for Ubuntu Phone that combines the Qt code for a dial with Qt code for reading GPS speed info.

Qt code for dial based on:

http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-customitems-dialcontrol-example.html

Qt code for GPS speed info based on:

https://github.com/yohanboniface/SensorsStatus

I have no commercial intentions with this app. Any suggestions for improvement are welcome!
